## TODO list :pencil2:  
1. Currently the app uses Summernote editor for making a blog post, future look to integrate markdown editors.  
2. Improving comments and replies. (The current implementation only considers a simple way to do stuff, this can be improved)  
3. About me page can be attempted to be made dynamic.
